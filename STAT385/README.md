# Statistical Programming Methods

This directory contains course materials for STAT 385 - "Statistical Programming Methods" which I took at the University of Illinois in the spring of 2020.

**Instructor:** Ha Khanh Nguyen

*Course Description:* Statisticians must be savvy in programming methods useful to the wide variety of analysis that they will be expected to perform. This course provides the foundation for writing and packaging statistical algorithms through the creation of functions and object oriented programming. Fundamental programming techniques and considerations will be emphasized. Students will also create dynamic reports that encapsulate their implemented algorithms.
