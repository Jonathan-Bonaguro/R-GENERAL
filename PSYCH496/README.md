# Advanced Current Topics in Psychology

This directory contains course materials for PSYC 496 - "Advanced Current Topics in Psychology" which I took at the University of Illinois in the spring of 2020.

**Instructor:** Babu Adhimoolam

*Course Description:* In this course you will learn how to program in R and subsequently use R for effective data analysis and communication of results. The course will teach you the basics of R programming (such as data types and structures in R, writing functions in R, loops and iterations, etc.) and will expand to teach R packages to clean up, transform, analyze and visualize the data set and to further communicate your results. You will be introduced to powerful visualization and transformation packages such as ggplot2 and dplyr in R. This course will also cover the concepts and tools for reproducible research with packages in R such as Markdown and knitr for integrating prose, code and results. You will be introduced to version control with Git and GitHub, which will enable you to create and manage repositories of your code (and data) and share them for publication or collaborative purposes. This course will serve as a foundation course for any other advanced statistical analysis/modelling course in R that you may plan for later or in parallel.
