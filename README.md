# R-GENERAL

Welcome to my R repository! This repository exists for fun. I wanted to use GitHub for two reasons:

1. Ability to show the world I am learning to code (I am significantly more motivated when I can share results!)
2. Keep track of my development overtime. 

**This is purely for fun!** 

Hoping to learn more about using R as a social science researcher interested in conflict, democracy, and political behavoir. 

#### Interests and Goals
1. Become more fluent in the tidyverse
2. Identify new packages and skills to learn 
3. Learn more advanced modeling skills for data
4. Maintain better reproducability standards by utilizng R Notebooks and Markdown
5. New Projects...?
6. ???
