# Introdcution to Data Science

This directory contains course materials for IS 457 - "Introduction to Data Science" which I took at the University of Illinois in the fall of 2018.

**Instructor:** Victoria Stodden

*Course Description:* This course introduces students to data science approaches that have emerged from recent advances in programming and computing technology. They will learn to collect and use data from a variety of sources, including the web, in a modern statistical inference and visualization paradigm. The course will be based in the programming language R, but will also use HTML, regular expressions, basic unix tools, XML, and SQL. Supervised and unsupervised statistical learning techniques made possible by recent advances in computing power will also be covered.
